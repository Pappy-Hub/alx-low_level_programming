__0x00. C - Hello, world__                       

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX Holberton School. It aims to learn about what is entry point, basic commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in C language.

__Files__

All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:
                                              

**TASKS**

0. Preprocessor

Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.


The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE

The output should be saved in the file c


1. Compiler

Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.


The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE

The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.

Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.o


2. Assembler

Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.


The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE

The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.

Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s


3. Name

Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.


The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE


4. Hello, puts

Write a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.


Use the function puts

You are not allowed to use printf

Your program should end with the value 0


5. Hello, printf

Write a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.


Use the function printf

You are not allowed to use the function puts

Your program should return 0

Your program should compile without warning when using the -Wall gcc option


6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation

Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.


You should produce the exact same output as in the example

Warnings are allowed

Your program should return 0

You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux to test the -m32 gcc option
